One way this problem could be solved is by writing a program that
randomly picks a number between 1 and 15. If the number is
less than or equal to 10, then the program prints "California." If
the number is above 10 but below 14 then the program will print
"Nevada." Finally if the number is greater than or equal to 14 
then the program will print "Utah."
